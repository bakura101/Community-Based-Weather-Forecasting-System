# üå¶Ô∏è Community-Based Weather Forecasting System

This project is a **community-based weather forecasting system** built using **Streamlit** and **Machine Learning**. It allows users to input weather parameters such as precipitation, temperature, and wind speed to predict the weather conditions using a trained machine learning model. The project is focused on a case study in Geidam Local Government.

## üåê Project Overview

The **Community-Based Weather Forecasting System** allows users to interactively input weather parameters to predict the possible weather conditions using a pre-trained machine learning model. This system is part of a case study focusing on **Geidam Local Government**, and its goal is to provide weather insights based on historical weather data.

The system uses **Streamlit** for the front end and user interaction and **scikit-learn** for the machine learning model. Additionally, the system has the potential to interact with a Flask-based API for deployment.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive UI**: A sidebar where users can input weather parameters such as precipitation, max/min temperature, and wind speed.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained model to predict weather conditions such as drizzle, rain, or sunny weather.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Immediate weather prediction results based on the user's input.
- **Probability Display**: Displays the probability of each weather condition.
- **Modular Code**: Easily extendable and customizable to fit other regions or weather datasets.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Backend**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
- **Data Handling**: pandas, numpy
- **Visualization**: Plotly, plost
- **Model Persistence**: pickle
- **Deployment (optional)**: Flask for API-based deployment

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/community-based-weather-forecasting-system.git
cd community-based-weather-forecasting-system
```

### 2. Set up a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download the Dataset and Pre-trained Model

Ensure that the necessary dataset and model files are placed in the appropriate directories:
- **Dataset**: `./dataset/weather_dataset.csv`
- **Model**: `./model/weather_model.pkl`
- **Scaler**: `./model/scaler.pkl`
- **Sidebar Image**: `./assets/img.jpg`

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit app, and you can access it in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## üñ• Usage

1. **Input Weather Parameters**: Use the sidebar to adjust weather parameters like precipitation, temperature, and wind speed.
2. **View Predictions**: The app will provide a prediction of the weather (e.g., drizzle, rain, sun) and display the probability of each possible weather condition.
3. **Customize**: You can update the dataset or retrain the machine learning model based on your needs.

### API Integration

You can integrate the app with a Flask-based API for deployment. Uncomment the API-related sections in `app.py` to enable communication with a backend server for model inference.

## ü§ù Contributing
